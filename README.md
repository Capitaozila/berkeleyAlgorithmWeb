# The Berkeley algorithm in JavaScript

This project is a simple implementation of the Berkeley algorithm in JavaScript. The Berkeley algorithm is a time synchronisation algorithm that allows a group of computers to synchronise their clocks with a central server. This project demonstrates how the algorithm works and how it can be implemented in a real-world scenario. You can read more about the Berkeley algorithm [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/berkeleys-algorithm/).

## Rive.App Animation?

The website uses some animations created with rive.app. The animations can be found in the `src/images` folder. The animations are exported as `.riv` files. You can find out more about Rive.app [here](https://rive.app/community/doc/introduction/docvphVOrBbl).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following tools installed on your computer:

- üìù [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- üõ†Ô∏è [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - To clone the repository from GitHub.

## How to use this project

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your computer:

### 1. üìÇ Clone the repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Capitaozila/BerkeleyClockWeb.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

After cloning, the project files will be in a new folder on your system. In order to work with these files, you will need to "enter" this folder in the terminal. Here's a step-by-step guide:

#### 2.1. Identifying the directory name

   When you clone a repository, it's downloaded into a folder with the same name as the repository on GitHub. In this case the repository name is **BerkeleyClockWeb**, so a new folder named **BerkeleyClockWeb** will be created.

#### 2.2. Using the 'cd' command

   In the Terminal, use the cd command to access this new folder. The basic format of the command is

   ```bash
   cd folder name
   ```

   Here the folder is called **BerkeleyClockWeb**, so

   ```bash
   cd BerkeleyClockWeb
   ```

   After this command, the terminal will be "inside" the project folder and you can execute commands specific to this project.

   **Note:** If you have cloned the repository to a different location, specify the full path to the folder. For example:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder/BerkeleyClockWeb
   ```

### 3. Open the project in VS Code

In the terminal, inside the project directory, run the following command

```bash
code .
```

**Explanation**
- `code`: Opens VS Code from the terminal.
- `.`: Represents the current directory, so this command opens the project directory directly in VS Code.
If the `code` command doesn't work, you may need to add it to your PATH:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (or **Cmd + Shift + P** on MacOS) to open the command palette.
3. Type and select 'Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH'.
4. Press **Enter** to install.

VS Code will then open with your project loaded.

### 4. Install the dependencies

You can use BeerCSS either via CDN or NPM, here we use NPM.

#### 4.2. Installing via NPM

   We'll use NPM to manage the project's dependencies. Run the following commands to install BeerCSS and Material Dynamic Colours

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 5. Running the project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project locally using parcel.
Follow the steps below:

1. **Start the local server:**
   - With the project open in VS Code, open the terminal and type

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Then, to build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Now you can see changes to the code in real time in your browser, without having to manually reload the page.

### 6. Customise the project

Feel free to edit the files in the `src` directory to customise the portfolio to your needs. The main sections of the site can be found and modified within this directory.
